mobilAP Version 2.0b
November 4, 2009

RELEASE NOTES

This version of mobilAP is not intended for production use. Most of the important features are functional, however, there are still unresolved issues, as well as a high probability of unknown bugs that need to be discovered and resolved.

We would appreciate you using this in a non-critical setting and providing feedback to mobilAP@daap.uc.edu

REQUIREMENTS AND SETUP

- mobilAP requires a web server running PHP 5.2. It _may_ run under 5.1 with the included JSON emulation functions, however it is likely that performance will suffer. It also requires the PDO (PHP data objects) extension for database abstraction. 

- In order to successfully complete the setup, the web server must be able to write to the html/mobilAP/config folder

- In order to use SQLite, the webserver must be able to write to the html/mobilAP/data folder. 

- Copy the HTML folder to your website. You can either copy the contents of the folder to the root of your website, or into a subfolder. Using a desktop browser, go to the URL of the folder you placed mobilAP in, it will begin the setup process of configuring the database, creating and initial user, and setting some initial options.


KNOWN ISSUES/PLANNED UPDATES BEFORE 2.0 final

- Documentation should be better and nicer looking

- Making the site private in the settings has no effect

- The handling of optional passwords is not complete

- The setup routine will not succeed if the webserver cannot write to the database file, even if you update it manually as directed.

- You will eventually be able to specify an alternate location of the SQLite database file

- You must specify the server timezone using the date.timezone php.ini setting. IF you do not have access to this file, you can add a date_default_timezone_set() call to html/mobilAP.php.

- It is hoped that timezone selection will eventually be part of the setup process

- Mass import of users is currently non-functional

- Evaluation questions are currently non-functional

- Uploading of directory images is non-functional/non-existent.

- Due to a coding flaw in Apple's Dashcode framework code, if you edit the project file and then re-publish the site, the desktop version will not work in Firefox. The template used to program the Stack Layout part calls a method that does not exist in Firefox. In the code that comes with mobilAP, that method is properly handled. If you republish the project it will overwrite that file (html/safari/Parts/parts.js).

- Bar charts have not been programmed

- The mobile site will always say "mobilAP" at the home screen. It is hoped that the final version will use the site title.

- There will eventually be a way to upload an alternate home screen icon. At this time, simply replace html/mobile/Images/WebClipIcon.png

- You will eventually be able to alter the wording and order of the main menu items

- Additional administration options will become available on the mobile interface, however some things will remain only in the desktop interface.


NOTES ABOUT THE DASHCODE PROJECT FILE

A Dashcode project file has been included to aid in customization. You will need to use the Dashcode that comes with OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard. 

Keep in mind that Dashcode does not handle CSS classes perfectly especially when renaming, so beware as you add and remove elements that it does not do unintentional things to the CSS file (it will!). Simply copying and pasting the original main.css file into the dashcode editor will typically reset things.

Due to how Dashcode does it's work, it is not possible to completely test software inside Dashcode. Because the data calls require PHP, and the dashcode "server" does not understand it, none of the data can be loaded. In order to test your changes you will have to deploy the site and run it from a server that has PHP.

Please contact mobilap@daap.uc.edu if you have any questions, bug submissions or requests. We make no guarantee, however, with respect to future releases.

Please note that technical support cannot be given, although paid consultation for conference help is available.
