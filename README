mobilAP Version 0.9

This version of the mobilAP conference edition includes two 
components, a PHP based back-end and a HTML/Javascript based front end.

The backend has the following requirements:

- PHP 5.x
- Access to a MySQL 5 database server (the code could be rewritten to use other DBs if necessary)

There are some configurations that have to be made:

x
1. Copy the contents of the html folder to a folder on your web server. It can be the root, but it doesn't have to be.
2. Set the db_host, db_user, db_password parameters in "inc/config.php" as necessary
3. Run setup.php which will create an admin user, and create the appropriate tables

Session configuration and schedule is accomplished using the admin.php script. 


NOTES

1. None of the admin scripts have any style to them.
2. There are probably things that don't work right because of some other assumptions that may turn out to be false.
3. There are probably some redundant files or CSS styles that haven't been cleaned up yet. 
4. the Js.php script is the main controller for AJAX communication between the DB and the front end.
5. The use of the APC cache is strongly encouraged. The calls in the code aren't quite there yet. but the stubs are there.
6. Sorry about the sparse documentation. This should get improved in the future once further developement occurs.
