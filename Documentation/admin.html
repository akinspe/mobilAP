<h1>mobilAP Documentation - Administration</h1>

<p>Once mobilAP has be set up, you can begin adding users and content. In order to administer the site you will need to login using the <a href="installation.html#setup">user you created</a> in the setup routine. All of the steps below assume you have logged in as an administrative user.</p>

<p>mobilAP uses a menu system for each of the sections. You can customize the label of each item as well as removing any items you don't want to see. By default the following menu items are shown:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Welcome - An editable page that represents the <i>home</i> page of your installation. You can <a href="admin_admin.html#content">edit it</a> using standard HTML.</li>
	<li><a href="admin_schedule.html">Schedule</a> - View and edit the schedule. This also includes adding and editing <a href="admin_session.html">sessions</a>.</li>
	<li><a href="admin_users.html">Directory</a> - View and edit the directory. Creating and managing users</li>
	<li><a href="admin_announcements.html">Announcements</a> - View and edit announcements</li>
	<li>Profile - Shown when a user is logged in. Allows the user to edit portions of their profile and change their password
	<li><a href="admin_admin.html">Admin</a> - Configures site wide settings. Only shown when an administrative user is logged in.</li>
	<li>Login/logout - By default users are kept logged in if they don't specifically log out. This serves as a convenience to users.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is important to note that only a limited number of administrative functions are available using the mobile interface. All functions are available in the desktop interface.</p>
