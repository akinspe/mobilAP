<h1>mobilAP Documentation - Extending and Contributing to mobilAP</h1>

<p>mobilAP is an open source project. Because of that, everything you might need to add on or enhance it is right in the source code. Because of the liberal <a href="license.html">license</a>, you can feel free to alter it to suit your needs. The page will outline some of the ways you can both alter mobilAP or participate in its future development</p>

<h2>Basic design</h2>
<p>mobilAP was built using Apple's Dashcode framework. This is a HTML/CSS/Javascript toolkit that was designed to produce code for both standard desktop browsers as well as the MobileSafari browser present in the iPhone and iPod touch. The framework contains <b>parts</b> that contain behavior and looks similar to built in controls on the system. It is beyond the scope of this documentation to outline all the parts and their behavior, but more information can be found in the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/AppleApplications/Conceptual/Dashcode_UserGuide/Contents/Resources/en.lproj/Introduction/Introduction.html">Dashcode Users Guide</a>.</p>

<h3>Folder Structure</h3>
<p>As much as it is feasible, the files created by dashcode are separated from mobilAP specific files. Dashcode creates several folders used by the application</p>
<ul>
	<li>mobile - Code and images specific to the mobile (iPhone OS) product</li>
	<li>Parts - Shared libraries and code</li>
	<li>safari - Code and images specific to the desktop product</li>
</ul>

<p>Inside the mobile and safari folders there are several files and folders:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Images - image assets used by that product. These images can be updated as desired</li>
	<li>index.html - Base HTML. Since the majority of the content is loaded via AJAX, this is mostly a shell. The index.html for the safari product is located in the root</li>
	<li>main.css - The primary style sheet. It has been grouped as much as feasible to ease in editing. It is recommended you use a style inspector such as the web inspected in Safari to trace style rules</li>
	<li>main.js - The primary javascript file for this product. It contains the majority of the product specific code.</li>
	<li>Parts - A folder with the dashcode parts definitions as well as parts Images. Since these are automatically generated by dashcode, take care in editing them</li>
</ul>

<h2>CSS and image alterations</h2>
<p>The easiest alterations to make are style changes. If you wish to make changes, it is recommended that you use a CSS inspector such as Safari's web inspector. This will make finding the correct style easier. Edit the <b>main.css</b> file in both the <i>mobile</i> and <i>safari</i> folders as needed.</p>
