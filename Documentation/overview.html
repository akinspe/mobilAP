<h2>Schedule</h2>
<p>You can use mobilAP with or without a schedule. The schedule allows you to organize sessions by their start and ending time, include room and supplementary information. Administrators can add and edit the schedule. Schedule information is independent from session information, so you can schedule a session as many times as you would like. Scheduling a session multiple times is useful when you want to retain the same links, questions, discussion across multiple times.</p>

<a name="directory"></a>
<h2>Directory</h2>
<p>The directory is used to organize the users of your event. Users can browse the directory to get name, contact information and photographs. Administrators can add, edit and remove users.</p>

<a name="session"></a>
<h2>Sessions</h2>
<p>The heart of mobilAP is the session interface. Depending on the context, a session could represent a presentation, a single class meeting or perhaps a series of meetings. Sessions can be administered by the site administrators or by the designed presenters of the session. This allows you to give administrative abilities to users only in the sessions they are presenting. Sessions provide the following services:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Link sharing - Users can share web links with others. If desired, the administrators can restrict who can post links</li>
	<li>Question/Response - Presenters can create multiple choice questions that the users can answer, complete with auto updating charts as people answer.</li>
	<li>Discussion - IM style discussion where logged in users can participate in a back-channel conversation</li>
	<li>Evaluation - Users can rate the session based on a site defined series of questions created by the administrators.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these features can be enabled or disabled independently for each session as desired
 </p>
<a name="announcements"></a>
<h2>Announcements</h2>
<p>Announcements are useful to convey important information to the users not tied to a particular session. Only administrators can post announcements.</p>
